        <h2>What I did</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="submiddle">For the Newb Config set of scripts, I learned some fairly basic shell scripting to create a set of scripts that I think would make it easier for a newer use to Linux to use the terminal.</p> 
        <p class="submiddle">The purpose was to create scripts that would not interfere, with the user, but rather work in the background. It is all open source at <a href="https://github.com/5late/Newb-Config" class="link">this GitHub repo</a>!</p>
        <p class="submiddle">I made the scripts as modular as possible, so users could decide which features they installed, and which they did not. I also documented the entire project in depth through the README and comments in the main install script.</p>
	<p class="submiddle">To install the script without having to clone the repo, you can download/wget from <a href="https://me.slatedev.xyz/projects/newbcontent/install.sh" class="link">this link.</a></p> 
	<p class="submiddle">To see the script in plain text before you install it and run it, see <a href="https://me.slatedev.xyz/projects/newbconfig/install.txt" class="link">this link.</a></p> 
	<p class="submiddle">I suggest reading #installation in the README of the github repo which you can find <a href="https://github.com/5late/Newb-Config#readme" class="link"> here.</a> </p>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>

    <p class="submiddle">Shell/Bash (learned how to use the language)</p>
    <p class="submiddle">How to make scripts independant and modular.</p>
    <p class="submiddle">How to document my progress, and how to document the project for anyone to understand.</p>
