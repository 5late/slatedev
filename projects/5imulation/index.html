    <div>
        <p class="submiddle">For 5imulation, I wrote the entire logic of how the world would repopulate. There were many variables I took into account, and ran the simulation many times, to compare results.</p>
        <p class="submiddle">I then wrote another simulation about how disease can spread, with different variables to control different aspects of how the virus could be transmitted.  It's all open source at <a href="https://github.com/5late/5imulation" class="link">this GitHub repo</a>!</p>

    </div>
    <p class="submiddle">Python</p>
    <p class="submiddle">How to think about human naturally interact.</p>
    <p class="submiddle">How to write programs that print directly to stdout rather than to an API like Discord.</p>
    <p class="submiddle">Simple (yet complex) math formulas to calculate chance of infection, and more.</p>
